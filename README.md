>**<p align="justify"> Abstract:** *This repository presents the research undertaken in the Vodafone Data Science Challenge (2021). The purpose of the challenge was that of predicting the nature of the Vodafone customers interactions with Tobi Digital Assistant to enhance Vodafone Customer Service. The research was based on a dataset of supervised interactions parameters used to classify customers communications with Tobi. Leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) along with some inspiration taken from sequence classification models and deep recommender systems, we designed a model to take two inputs, one representing the user history on past interactions and one composed by the sessions events in order to draw conclusions on the nature of the interactions.*
